# How well do you _really_ know JavaScript?

<ThemeSelector />

It's pretty well known that JavaScript has strange syntax and semantics. Let's see how familiar you are with them! This quiz's format is mostly inspired by [this Java quiz](https://goldenstack.net/blog/java_quiz).

Assume that code segments provided are executed in an isolated, modern ECMAScript environment.

## 1.

Consider the following code segment.

```javascript
function get(array) {
	return array.at('start');
}
```

What is the result of calling the `get` function with the array `['first', 'second', 'third']`?

<Answers>
<Answer correct>

`'first'`

</Answer>
<Answer>

`'second'`

</Answer>
<Answer>

`undefined`

</Answer>
<Answer>

A `TypeError` is thrown because `at` is not an array method.

</Answer>
<Answer>

A `TypeError` is thrown because the `at` method takes an integer argument.

</Answer>

<Answers>
<Answer>

The function executes successfully, creating a local variable `newValue` set to `'hello'`.
